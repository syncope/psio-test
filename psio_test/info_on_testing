test setup: using unittest

test fixture
    A test fixture represents the preparation needed to perform one or more tests, and any associate cleanup actions.
    This may involve, for example, creating temporary or proxy databases, directories, or starting a server process.
test case
    A test case is the individual unit of testing.
    It checks for a specific response to a particular set of inputs. unittest provides a base class, TestCase, which may be used to create new test cases.
test suite
    A test suite is a collection of test cases, test suites, or both.
    It is used to aggregate tests that should be executed together.
test runner
    A test runner is a component which orchestrates the execution of tests and provides the outcome to the user.
    The runner may use a graphical interface, a textual interface, or return a special value to indicate the results of executing the tests. 


test case:
 class that inherits from base class
 all tests are methods with naming convention "test_*"
 call run() for execution


 class unittest.TestSuite(tests=())
 
    addTest(test)   Add a TestCase or TestSuite to the suite.

    addTests(tests) Add all the tests from an iterable of TestCase and TestSuite instances to this test suite.

    run(result)
